<p class="auto-style7">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style7">For my project, I would like to follow my passions in 
automation, AI and robotic technology. The project that I want to develop is 
automation of the Dandenong to Watergardens railway line as part of the 
Melbourne Metro Project with the integration of AI and robotic control to ensure 
a reliable passenger railway service that can cater for an ever growing city 
which Melbourne is forecasted to be especially in the growth corridors near 
Watergardens, Caroline Springs and the south eastern suburbs (Victorian Planning 
Authority, 2019). AI and robotic control will be a major part of this project 
because the aim of this project is to reduce as much human intervention required 
to run a busy railway line and integrating technology into the railway line such 
as real time passenger information, train scheduling, maintenance and 
streamlined operations (Swiss Federal Railways, 2017). <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style7">The main features of this product will include:<o:p></o:p></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Automated train control. Automated 
train control is using driverless technology on this corridor between 
Watergardens and Dandenong. Driverless technology has been in place around the 
world and it has been successful in many countries including Australia with the 
Sydney Metro. With Automated train control, the train driver will not need to 
manually drive the train along the corridor and can assume a supervisory role of 
the train where the driver can just open and close the doors. Using automated 
train control will improve reliability because more trains can run due to 
automated train control allowing more timeslots, which in return will allow more 
train services to run (Swiss Federal Railways, 2017). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Use of Artificial Intelligence to 
determine efficient scheduling of trains, timetabling and infrastructure 
management of the railway line. Artificial Intelligence is becoming more and 
more prevalent in society (Miailhe,2017). By incorporating artificial 
intelligence into this railway line, it will streamline operations such as 
maintenance and scheduling because AI can be used to help determine the most 
efficient way to schedule the train services for each day to ensure the best 
possible service to the customers and it can feed into the Automated train 
control system to ensure that trains are signalled so that as much time slots 
are freed up as possible to ensure many services can run during peak hours. In 
infrastructure management and maintenance artificial intelligence can be used to 
manage this because by collating real time data from rolling stock and 
infrastructure such as signals and systems AI can determine when pieces of 
infrastructure may need maintenance so operational management can determine when 
maintenance can occur to reduce downtime for the railway line and reduce costs 
on maintenance labour. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Incorporation of the use of real time 
information and data. The automated train control system and AI can be linked to 
the passenger information system along this railway line. Linking these services 
together will allow more accurate real time information to passengers because 
the Automated Train Control system can track the location and schedule of each 
train along the railway line during its journey which allows real time feedback 
to the passenger information system so passengers can receive information on 
when their train will arrive for better convenience for passengers in their 
commute. Also, disruptions can be better managed as well because the Automated 
Train Control system can know when a disruption occurs, passengers are informed 
more accurately about the situation and AI can determine the best course of 
action to manage the disruption along the railway line such as notifying a 
maintenance crew, isolating the faulty system or arranging a emergency bus 
replacement plan. Finally the use of real time data and information can be 
incorporated into security and safety where if a trespasser is found on the 
railway line, emergency services can be notified early about the situation and 
all trains are slowed down on the railway line or suspended until the trespasser 
is found and removed reducing the chance of a fatality occurring. <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="auto-style7">The tools required for this project to occur successfully 
are:<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style7">Sourcing an efficient Automatic Control System. An 
efficient and effective automated train control system on the market can be 
sourced and tailored to the conditions of this railway line (Bombardier 
Transportation, 2019). Another alternative is to develop an automated control 
system for Melbourne; however, this will cost more money. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style11">Development of artificial intelligence for the railway. 
Obviously for this project to occur successfully an artificial intelligence must 
be developed for all the automation to run. Just line the ATC, it can be sourced 
from the open market or can be developed in house for the railway line.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style7">Collating existing data and developing databases to 
manage the real time data and information required. As the existing Dandenong to 
Watergardens railway line has tons of big data that needs to be mined and 
integrated successfully into an information system for the AI and the ATC 
systems to work effectively, an efficient database and data management system 
must be developed for the AI and ATC to communicate with that incorporates the 
existing data already on the railway line such as rolling stock, infrastructure, 
signals, structures and line data such as landmarks, stations and key locations 
(SAS Institute, 2019). <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style7">The skills required for this to occur successfully are:<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style7">Automated Train Control system engineer-An engineer will 
be required to source and develop the automated train control system that is 
tailored for Melbourne. The engineer with also manage the day to day operations 
of the automated train control system (Bombardier Transportation, 2019). <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="auto-style7">Systems and data analyst-A data and systems analyst will 
develop a database system and manage the incorporation of the existing data on 
the railway required for the Automation to occur (GTI Media, 2014). <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="auto-style7">Integration engineer-An integration engineer will develop 
solutions to integrate existing technology such as rolling stock and 
infrastructure into the automated system (GTI Media, 2014).<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style7">Cybersecurity expert-Because this automated system like 
any computer system is susceptible to hacking and threats a cyber security 
expert will be required to ensure the security of this system because if the 
security of the system is compromised, it can lead to massive disruptions which 
can bring the city into an internal emergency, not to mention the breach of 
customers data (GTI Media, 2014). <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style7">Outcomes of this project.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style13"><span class="auto-style10">The outcomes of this project 
are that it will lead to a more efficient and reliable railway line that can</span><span class="auto-style10" style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style10">adapt to the needs of an ever growing city by 
running more train services more often when needed in the growth corridors of 
Melbourne in the north west and the south east. Furthermore, it can lead to more 
return for the railway due to reduced costs which can lead to increased profits 
which can be incorporated back into the railway for continual improvement.
