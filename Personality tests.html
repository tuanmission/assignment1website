<p class="auto-style7">The first picture shows my meyers brigg perosonality test 
result, the second picture on the right is my learning style test result and the 
third picture on the bottom shows my creativity test result. </p>
<p class="auto-style7">What these results mean for me is firstly that I have 
strong creativity, extroversive, thinking and judging skills. In a group 
situation, I would be effective as a delegator of tasks and combined with my 
strong creative thinking I am able to develop solutions to problems that occur 
as part of a team. Have strong judgement skills is important because to lead a 
team, it is important to judge each team member’s ideas and opinions combined 
with extraversion to have strong awareness of other team members. These skills 
from these tests show that I am a very strong team player and being a very 
strong team player is a very important skill in IT because there will be 
situations where I must collaborate within a team as shown in my ideal job 
position description. For my learning style, I am more of a visual learner and a 
auditory learner. Being an auditory learner is a good asset in a team-based 
situation combined with strong listening skills because taking on feedback from 
others is very important in a team situation. Onto being a visual learner, it 
allows me to visualise problems from the bigger picture and I prefer to draw out 
the problem on a piece of paper to conceptualize the problem at large in order 
to define an effective solution, while taking on other team members feedback. 
When forming a team, all these skills are important because an effective team 
member requires creativity, thinking, intuitive and being extroverted in order 
to form strong professional relationships. For leadership, having strong 
critical thinking, judging and listening skills are important because as a team 
leader these are very important attributes when in a position of leadership 
because leadership depends on the fundamental principles of understanding 
others. <o:p></o:p></p>
