<p class="auto-style7">Name Tuan Luong<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style7">Student Number:s3652729<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style7">My name is Tuan Luong I am a curious, enthusiastic and 
passionate person who loves technological things and how they work around me. My 
nationality is that I was born in Vietnam, but moved to Australia in 2002 as a 
tiny little four year old international prep student before I got my Australian 
Citizenship in 2006. My interests is swimming and being in the underwater world 
with my snorkelling and diving since I love the peace and quiet of the 
underwater world where it is calm and there is peace. I also love riding my 20 
inch foldable bike around the neighbourhood and the city as well. <o:p>&nbsp;My 
background is blue which is my favourite colour and ties in with my passion of 
underwater things. </o:p>
</p>
<p class="auto-style10"><span class="auto-style9">My interests in IT is 
networking, databases and programming due to the logical and processed based 
nature of programming with the visual thinking required for network design. My 
interest in IT in started after 3 years of studying in the health sciences that 
I began to realise that my true calling and my passion in technology and how the 
world revolved around me with all the technology. What sparked my interest in IT 
was ever since I entered the country I entered a digital age and my parents gave 
me my first Nintendo game and I was fascinated in how the Gameboy worked. I was 
always had a strong interest in IT throughout my childhood of using computers 
and playing video games during my spare time to drown out the stresses of the 
real world revolving around me. Another thing that sparked my interest in IT is 
that I always knew how computers worked and I would troubleshoot a lot of 
computer issues that occur in the classroom in both school and university. I 
decided to come to RMIT because I was part of RMIT for a long time for my 
post-secondary education studying health and decided to go back to my roots in 
technology. RMIT has always been supportive of me and I’m familiar with the 
environment at RMIT.</span><span class="auto-style9" style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="auto-style7">What I expect to learn during my studies is software 
engineering and development, programming, networking and developing solutions to 
business problems. <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="auto-style2">
<o:p>Below this is a beuatiful photo of me in the best place where I belong, the 
underwater world. This photo was taken of me scuba diving in the great barrier 
reef during my 1 week holiday during the RMIT semester break and this is what I 
love doing besides my computers and technology. </o:p>
